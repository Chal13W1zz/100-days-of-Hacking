####  `Day 1`

Buffer Overflow Attacks

Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred from one location to another. A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer like overloading it with datas to break it down.

`REQUIRED INSTALLATIONS TO SET UP The LAB`

Installations Of Windows 10 Enterprise, Immunity Debugger And Vulnserver On Vmware Player Resources can Be [Found Here For Downloads](https://github.com/fr334aks/100-days-of-Hacking/blob/main/Muzec/Resources.md)

Note i copy the window IP and the port 9999 is default in vulnserver and we are done with the set up......


####  `Day 2`

`SPIKING`

Spiking is done to figure out what is vulnerable in an application. We can use a tool called “generic_send_tcp” which is also present on kali linux to generate TCP connections with the vulnerable application.

During spiking, in .spk script, we have to try all commands and check at which command the application crashes, in this case, it came out to be TRUN command and .spk script at which the application is crashing looks something like this.

STATS .spk script
```
s_readline();
s_string("STATS ");
s_string_variable("0");
```

TRUN .spk script

```
s_readline();
s_string("TRUN ");
s_string_variable("0");
```
Ok let try it on the vulnserver we have on our windows 10 to figure out at exactly which command the application is crashing.

Using The STATS.spk script we found nothing let try using the TRUN.spk script.

And it crashed with the “TRUN” command. Once we figure that out we are good to go ahead with that.
