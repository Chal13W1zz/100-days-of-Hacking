memory and the stack
a computer stores data In primary(<B>registers</B>,ram,and rom) and secondary memory(hard disk)<br>primary memory are fast but they do not have a large size .Secondary stoages are slower when compared to primary memory 
when it comes to computing data speed,and size or capacity are key issues. 

Important registers 
eax 
Ebp -base frame pointer
ESI source in string /memory operations
ESP -stack pointer
EDI
EIP instruction pointer
EBX
ECX counter in loops
EDX

Eflags this register contains a record of the result of operations that were caried out
