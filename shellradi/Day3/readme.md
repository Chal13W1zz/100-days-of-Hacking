##  Phase 1: Information gathering
 
I will be going through gathering all the information about the target network that is necessary for me to break in.
Like performing network mapping using Nmap and discover live hosts within a
given IP address range, discovering listening services that are running on network ports bound to those hosts. 
Then iâ€™ll learn to interrogate these individual services for specific information, including but not limited to the following:

-  Software name and version number
-  Current patch and configuration settings
-  Service banners and HTTP headers
-  Authentication mechanisms


Alongside Nmap i will be using other powerful open source
pentest tools such as the Metasploit framework CrackMapExec (CME), Impacket, and
many others to further enumerate information about network targets, services, and
vulnerabilities that you can take advantage of to gain unauthorized access to restricted
areas of the target network.


##   Phase 2: Focused penetration

I will be comprimising hosts and controlling  the network from the inside, since  i have identified 
vulnerable attack vectors throughout the environment.
I will learn several types of attack vectors that will
result in some form of remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable targets. RCE means
you can connect to a remote command prompt and type commands to your  
compromised victim that will be executed and will send output back to you at your prompt.
I will learn how to deploy custom web shells using vulnerable web 
applications.
I will compromise and take control over database servers, web servers, file shares, work-
stations, and servers residing on Windows and Linux operating systems.
