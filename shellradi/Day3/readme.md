## Phase 1: Information gathering
 
I will be going through gathering all the information about the target network that is necessary for me to break in.
Like performing network mapping using Nmap and discover live hosts within a
given IP address range, discovering listening services that are running on net-
work ports bound to those hosts. 
Then iâ€™ll learn to interrogate these individual ser-
vices for specific information, including but not limited to the following:

-  Software name and version number
-  Current patch and configuration settings
-  Service banners and HTTP headers
-  Authentication mechanisms


Alongside Nmap i will be using other powerful open source
pentest tools such as the Metasploit framework CrackMapExec (CME), Impacket, and
many others to further enumerate information about network targets, services, and
vulnerabilities that you can take advantage of to gain unauthorized access to restricted
areas of the target network.
