## Phase 1: Information gathering
 
I will be going through gathering all the information about the target network that is necessary for me to break in.
Like performing network mapping using Nmap and discover live hosts within a
given IP address range, discovering listening services that are running on net-
work ports bound to those hosts. 
Then iâ€™ll learn to interrogate these individual ser-
vices for specific information, including but not limited to the following:

-  Software name and version number
-  Current patch and configuration settings
-  Service banners and HTTP headers
-  Authentication mechanisms
