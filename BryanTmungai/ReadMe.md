# 100 DAYS OF HACKING ROADMAP
<p>- This repo will contain my journey as i learn: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Binary Exploitation</li>
  <li>Explot development</li>
  <li>Vulnerability discovery</li>
</ol>
<p>- By the end of these 100 days i would like to have grasped:
  <p>- x86 and x64 syntax,instruction sets,registers 
  <p>- writing explots with pwntools
  <p>- explot development 
  <p>- vulnerability discovery 
<p> - If time will allow i would love to delve into reverse engineering malware. </p>
<p> - This repo will also contain the resources that i will be using and some which i will find along the way. </p>
