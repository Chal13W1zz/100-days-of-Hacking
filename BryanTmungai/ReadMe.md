# 100 DAYS OF HACKING ROADMAP
<p>- This repo will contain my journey as i learn: </p>
  <ol>
     <li>Binary Exploitation</li>
     <li>Exploit development</li>
     <li>Vulnerability discovery</li>
  </ol>
<p>- By the end of these 100 days i would like to have grasped:
  <ol>
    <li>x86 and x64 syntax,instruction sets,registers</li>
    <li>writing explots with pwntools</li>
    <li>exploit development</li>
    <li>vulnerability discovery </li>
  </ol>
<p> - If time will allow i would love to delve into reverse engineering malware. </p>
<p> - This repo will also contain the resources that i will be using and some which i will find along the way. </p>
