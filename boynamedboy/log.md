####  `Day 2`
<p>- Went through how data is represented in memory(strings, integers) and various encodings that can be used(ascii,unicode)</p>

#### `Day 3`
<p>- Went through how an assembly program looks like and wrote a sample .asm simple code(declaring variables and Constants,addition, using registers, starting a program and finally exiting)

#### `Day 4`
<p>- Went through the tool chain and processes involved to have a running executable from the assembly code. This includes: assembling source file to produce object file, then linking file object files in an executable, and finally loading program into main memory for running as well functions of a debugger

#### `Day 5`
<p>- Went through the DDD/gdb Debugger, learnt program execution in debugger, setting breakpoints, run/continue, viewing registers and viewing the stack contents, and some debugger commands(both interactive and non-interactive).</p>

#### `Day 6`
<p>- Went though parts of instruction sets, that is their convections, conversion instructions(narrowing, widening, unsigned & unsigned) and integer arithmetic instructions(addition, subtraction and introductory multiplication) and consequently wrote their asm code. Hoping to finaliza on the instructions in the next few days<br>
